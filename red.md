I'm going to where the sun burns

And the heat stays in command

Come lay by my side

Right here



To where the river turns to dust

And god is never rushed

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world



It's seem to make sense

When brother Santo said

One more run be enough

Going to be enough



Money for everything

Silver toed boots and kerosene

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world



The buzzing stink and the choking

I can't stay no more

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I need you and the world



When I see you behind the glass

I forget that I'm in the cage

They bring me to Sunday mass

But it never wiped the rage



Red, I love you and the world



Seven months gone and seven years to go

Red I can't stand no more

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world

Red, I need you and the world
