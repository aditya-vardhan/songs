I'm going tooo... Where the sun burns And the

Heeeaat stays in command

Come and lay by my side... Right heeere



To where the.... river turns to dust And

God is never rushed

Come and lay by my side Right here



Red, I love you and the world



It seemed to make sense When Brother Santo? Said O 

One more runbeenough

Gonna be enough!



Money for everything... Silver toed boots And

Karosene aua

Come and lay by my side Right here



Red, I love you and the world



Well the buzzing, the stiiink and the choking

I can't stay no more

Come and lay by my side Right here



Red, I need you and the world



When I see you behind the glass (c major g  a minor f)

I Forget that I'm innnnn the cage

They bring me to Sunday mass

But it never o wiped the ra......ge



Red, I love you and the world



Sevenmonths gone and sevenyears, To go Red

I can't stand no more (pick 4th string with c major instead of 5th string)

Come and lay by my side Right here



Red, I love you and the world

Red, I need you and the world
