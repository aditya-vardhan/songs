I'm going tooo... 

Where the sun burns 

And the.... 

Heeeaat stays in command

Come lay by my side

Right heeere



To where the.... river turns to dust And...

God is never rushed

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world



It's seem to make sense

When Brother Santo 

Said One more runbeenough

Gonna be enough



Money for everything

Silver toed boots and kerosene aha

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world



(Well) the buzzing stiiink and the choking

I can't stay no more

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I need you and the world



When I see you behind the glass (c major g  a minor f)

I Forget that I'm iiiiin the cage

They bring me to Sunday mass

But it nevero wiped the ra......ge



Red, I love you and the world



Sevenmonths gone and sevenyears

To go Red

I can't stand no more (pick 4th string with c major instead of 5th string)

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world

Red, I need you and the world
