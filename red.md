I'm going to 

Where the sun burns 

And the 

Heat stays in command

Come lay by my side

Right here



To where the river turns to dust And

God is never rushed

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world



It's seem to make sense When

Brother Santo 

Said One more run be enough

Gonna be enough



Money for everything

Silver toed boots and kerosene aha

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world



Well the buzzing stink and the choking

I can't stay no more

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I need you and the world



When I see you behind the glass

Forget that I'm in the cage

They bring me to Sunday mass

But it never wiped the rage



Red, I love you and the world



Seven months gone and seven years

To go Red

I can't stand no more

Come lay by my side

Right here



Red, I love you and the world

Red, I need you and the world
